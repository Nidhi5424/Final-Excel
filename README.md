## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

1. **Cleaned Data (Table Format)**

   * Raw data was cleaned and converted into a structured **Excel Table**.
   * This makes filtering, formatting, and creating pivots much easier.

2. **Pivot Summaries**

   * Multiple **pivot tables** created from the cleaned dataset.
   * Each pivot has a **unique table name**.
   * Examples:

     * Sales by Region
     * Sales by Category & Sub-Category
     * Profit by Segment
     * Top 10 Customers

3. **KPI & Summary Sheet**

   * A dedicated sheet containing important business KPIs, calculated with Excel formulas:

     * ðŸ“ˆ Total Sales
     * ðŸ’° Total Profit
     * ðŸ“¦ Total Quantity Sold
     * ðŸ‘¥ Number of Customers
     * ðŸ›’ Average Order Value
   * Formulas like `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `AVERAGE` were used.

4. **Dashboard**

   * A clean, professional dashboard designed with:

     * Pivot charts (bar, line, pie, stacked column).
     * Slicers for interactivity (e.g., by Region, Category, Segment).
     * Conditional formatting to highlight high/low performance.
     * Custom formatting (icons, data bars, color scales) to improve readability.
